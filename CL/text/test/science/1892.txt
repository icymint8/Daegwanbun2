Here's what the hurricane categories mean
The Atlantic hurricane season begins on June 1 and runs through Nov. 30. Hurricanes are rated on theSaffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which includes five categories based on the storm's sustained wind speeds. It also estimates possible damage to property, ranging from "some damage" to "catastrophic."  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration haspredicted an "above average" seasonfor 2024, with  with 17 to 25 named storms, 8 to 13 hurricanes, and 4 to 7 major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher. The 2023 season saw its first major storm in late Augustwith Hurricane Franklin, a Category 4 hurricane that did not make landfall but still led to "life-threatening surf and rip current conditions" along the U.S. East Coast. That was followed by Idaliawhich hit Florida's Gulf Coast as a major hurricane on Aug. 30, and then Lee, churning in the Atlantic with wind speeds at times reaching as high as Category 5. If a storm is a Category 3, 4 or 5, it is deemed a "major" hurricane due to the potential for "significant loss of life and damage," the National Hurricane Center says. Hurricanes that fall into categories 1 or 2 are still considered dangerous, the center says. Here is how the scale breaks down, according to the National Hurricane Center, starting with a look at the most powerful: Sustained wind speed of157 mph or higher  Sustained wind speed of 130-156 mph Sustained wind speed of 111-129 mph Sustained wind speed of 96-110 mph Sustained wind speed of 74-95 mph In the midst of an unusually ferocious string of hurricanes in 2017, there was some speculation about whether storms could hit a Category 6. There is officiallyno such thing as a Category 6 hurricane. But the idea of revising or adding to the scale has beendiscussed by some climate scientists who believe the current categories may not be adequate for increasingly extreme stormsin the future. Hurricane Katrina, in 2005, reached Category 5 over the Gulf of Mexico but made landfall as a Category 3 storm, ultimately flooding more than 80% of New Orleans and killing more than 1,200 people â€” making it one of the deadliest hurricanes to strike the U.S. It is one of the costliest hurricanes in U.S. history, doing more than $75 billion in damage. Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida all saw destruction from Katrina.
