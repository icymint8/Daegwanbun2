2 Mississippi inmates captured after escape from prison
The two inmates who escaped from a jail in southwestern Mississippi were captured on Saturday, officials confirmed. The two men — who were awaiting trial on murder charges in separate counties — broke out of the Claiborne County Detention Center at about 2:20 a.m. local time Friday, sparking a county-wide search by multiple law enforcement agencies. On Saturday, Tyrekennel Collins, 24, and Dezarrious Johnson, 18, were captured at an abandoned home, CBS affiliate WJTV-TV reported. The Claiborne County Sheriff's Department shared a video of the arrest on Facebook. The jail is in Port Gibson, about 60 miles southwest of Jackson. Camera footage showed Collins and Johnson escaping through the ceiling and leaving behind an outside wall, Claiborne County Sheriff Edward Goods told local reporters. Johnson injured one of his legs during the escape and was walking with a limp, the sheriff's department said. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation said Collins and Johnson are considered armed and dangerous. WJTV-TVreported Collins is charged with murder in the October killing of his cousin in Copiah County, which is about 40 miles (64.4 kilometers) west of Claiborne County. Court records on Friday did not show an indictment for Collins.
