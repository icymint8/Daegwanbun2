Driver charged with DWI in deadly Long Island nail salon crash, police say
DEER PARK, N.Y. -- A man behind the wheel of an SUV was drunk and speeding when he crashed into a Long Island nail salon, killing an off-duty New York City Police Department officer and three other people, police said Saturday. Suffolk County Police arrested Steven Schwally, of Dix Hills, and charged him with DWI after the crash in Deer Park. The four victims killed in the crash have been identified as 50-year-old Meizi Zhang, 41-year-old Yan Xu, 37-year-old Jiancai Chen and 30-year-old Emilia Rennhack, an off-duty NYPD officer who lived in Deer Park. Nine other people, including a 12-year-old girl, were injured and rushed to local hospitals. One person had to be airlifted. Police say Schwally was among those hospitalized. He suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Police say he will be arraigned at a later date. Hawaii Nail and Spa on Grand Boulevard was busy with customers around 4:30 p.m. Friday when Schwally allegedly crashed his black Chevy Traverse into the storefront, killing four people and injuring eight others. Schwally also suffered minor injuries in the crash. Witnesses reported seeing the vehicle swerving as it left the Kohl's parking lot across the street from the salon. "It was just the most horrifying, traumatizing, upsetting thing I've ever seen in my life ... I couldn't sleep last night at all," a witness named Hahn told CBS New York's Kristie Keleshian on Saturday. Hahn was at a nearby light when she says she saw the driver speed past her. "And I thought, 'This guy is blowing a light.' And I had no idea what I was about to see, but I watched him come right across Grand Boulevard and just right into the salon," Hahn said. Fire officials say the vehicle traveled all the way through the building, remaining stuck in the back of the salon for hours after the crash. The storefront was boarded up Saturday. Family members of employees gathered items left behind as longtime customers tried to console brokenhearted loved ones. John Vassallo told CBS New York he's been coming to Hawaii Nail and Spa since it opened about 15 years ago. "This is a staple here, this nail salon," Vassallo said. Customers describe the salon as having a lively, welcoming atmosphere. "They treated you like family. They didn't treat you like another dollar," one customer said. "They are the greatest people. They are so family-oriented. It's unbelievable. It's sad, and it's a big, big loss," Deer Park resident Mike McClorey said. Longtime customers say the man who died was the store manager, known as Kenny. His wife also works at the salon. New York City officials posted tributes to Rennhack on social media Saturday. NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban wrote, "Our hearts are heavy as we mourn the loss of Police Officer Emilia Rennhack, whose life was taken far too soon.   We offer our support to Emilia's family, friends, and co-workers during this incredibly difficult time. Please keep our officer and her loved ones in your thoughts and prayers." Mayor Eric Adams wrote in part, "It is never easy to get word that we have lost one of our own dedicated public servants â€” no matter the circumstances." Saturday night, bunting was seen outside the 102nd Precinct, where Rennhack worked, and the American flag was at half staff.
