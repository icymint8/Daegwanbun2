The Carroll County Sheriff's Office announced late Friday that Investigator Taylor Bristow died from his injuries from the shooting Tuesday. Bristow was shot and critically wounded while serving a Georgia Bureau of Investigation warrant in a neighborhood in Carrollton, which is about 50 miles southwest of Atlanta. A procession escorted Bristow's body from Grady Memorial Hospital to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's crime lab for an autopsy,according to CBS Atlanta affiliate WANF-TV. "Tonight, we mourn the passing of Investigator Bristow, who has left this earth and gained his heavenly wings," the sheriff's office said in a statement posted on Facebook. "He served our community with unwavering passion and dedicated his life to protecting the citizens of Carroll County." Bristow was assisting the GBI in executing a search warrant by its agents with the child exploitation and computer crimes unit. The GBI said the suspect, Christopher Bly, ran into the home before firing a handgun, striking himself and Bristow. Bly, 40, was pronounced dead at the scene. The GBI said during its search that agents located and seized multiple electronic devices that contained child sexual abuse materials.
