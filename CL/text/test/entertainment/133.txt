Here are all the songs on the DNC roll call playlist
The Democratic National Convention turned a routine roll call into a dance party Tuesday night as Democrats celebrated Vice President Kamala Harris as the party's nominee for the 2024 presidential race. The ceremonial roll call became a star-studded fest that included a live performance from Lil Jon and a medley of songs from Dolly Parton, Beyonc√©, Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars and others that corresponded to each state and U.S. territory. The roll call concluded with Harris' home state of California, which was intentionally left until the end, and featured four songs, including two from Kendrick Lamar. Harris later appeared on video from Milwaukee, where she was holding a rally, and thanked supporters for nominating her. The playlist was put together by celebrity DJ Cassidy, whoposted his setliston his Spotify. Following the event, DJ Cassidy told Rolling Stone that he got a call a month ago from a producer of the convention, who told him they wanted him to become the convention's "first musical maestro" for the DNC's roll call. He told the outlet that there were many hours of "meticulous curation" involved in the choosing of songs, saying, "None of them were freestyle." DJ Cassidy said it was a "surreal feeling to see the 'Pass the Mic' experience connected to the roll call." "It hit me differently than I thought it would," he said. "It felt like it brought a new life to the process that people take for granted. And the process is giving people a voice." The third night of the DNC kicks off Wednesday, with a focus on how the party's new ticket plans to fight for America's freedoms. Harris' running mate,Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, is expected to officially accept the vice presidential nomination and will be among the list of speakers.
