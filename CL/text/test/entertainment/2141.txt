Curtain goes up on 2024 Tribeca Festival, with tribute to Robert De Niro
The Tribeca Festival returns to screens and event venues across New York City on Wednesday, showcasing 114 feature-length narrative and documentary films — many of them world or New York premieres — along with shorts, revivals and restorations, filmmaker Q&As, audio storytelling, and music performances. This year marks the 23rd edition of the festival, which was launched in 2002 by Robert De Niro, Jane Rosenthal and Craig Hatkoff to help revitalize a city wounded by 9/11. Since then it has grown into a major event for film lovers and media figures that also encompasses non-cinematic art forms: podcasts, demos of role-playing games, immersive art, and virtual reality/augmented reality exhibitions. This year's film slate was selected from more than 13,000 submissions, more than ever before. Tribeca was conceptualized as a storytelling festival, said festival director and VP of programming Cara Cusumano, "and that's been kind of our guiding light and the root of where all these other programs evolved from. Where is the most interesting storytelling happening? How are audiences today consuming stories? Increasingly it's not always a 90-minute feature film experience."  Cusumano said that each of the festival's verticals has cinematic storytelling in their DNA: "They feel like logical evolutions, but the scale is smaller. There's probably 10 to 12 TV events, a similar number of immersive presentations, podcasts, games. So, we think of it kind of like the spokes on a wheel where we want to be sure that we're representing these communities of creators, and communities of audiences, within the festival, while preserving the real core DNA of the film festival. "We want to create a creative ecosystem where all these folks are not siloed in their own industry," Cusumano said. "The walls are permeable and they can meet each other, they can meet the industry at large, and cross-pollinate in a way that we hope is creatively productive for everybody. The hope is to introduce people from games, podcasts, immersive, etc., to a more traditional film industry, and see where those points of connection might lie or be found, unexpectedly or not.  "And for audiences, too. Maybe what any single ticket buyer is drawn to is usually something that they're familiar with or in their wheelhouse, but maybe because there's all this other stuff going on, they get drawn into a different world and can discover something that they didn't set out to find. That's really hopefully the experience of discovery that Tribeca can offer that is unique." But just as the festival has grown in scope over the years, it's also contracting. After expanding its offerings throughout the city and, later, with virtual screenings once COVID postponed the 2020 festival (allowing film fans from across the country to attend), it's now ended the Tribeca at Home program, to focus on communal, in-person screenings. And while film venues are primarily in Manhattan, special events are still being held in the outer boroughs, including a late-night dance party honoring the 70th anniversary of Godzilla at Baby's All Right in Brooklyn (June 7). One of the major components of Tribeca 2024 is De Niro Con, marking the actor's 80th birthday. "De Niro Is an Icon" weaves together an exhibit and an immersive film installation projected on six screens, celebrating more than 40 iconic De Niro film characters (June 6-16 at Spring Studios). Classic De Niro performances will also be screened on June 14, including "The Godfather Part II," Quentin Tarantino's "Jackie Brown" (in 35mm), "Analyze This," and "Silver Linings Playbook," with Q&As following most films. There will also be the world premiere of Chazz Palminteri's new film based on his one-man stage show, "A Bronx Tale," a play that De Niro adapted as his directorial film debut back in 1993.  On Wednesday, the festival's opening night feature is the Hulu documentary"Diane von Furstenberg: Woman in Charge,"a profile of the iconic designer, who was both a princess and a queen of fashion (June 5, 6, 15).

There are also profiles of notable celebrities, past and present, in the worlds of music, art and sports, from tennis legend Roger Federer ("Federer: Twelve Final Days," June 10, 14, 16) to Bruce Springsteen sideman Stevie Van Zandt ("Stevie Van Zandt: Disciple," June 8, 10, 15), to Liza Minnelli ("Liza: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story," June 12, 13, 15), Elizabeth Taylor ("Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes," June 11, 12, 16), "Hamilton" actress Renée Elise Goldsberry ("Satisfied," June 15, 16), Luther Vandross ("Luther: Never Too Much," June 13, 14, 15); Claude Nobs, founder of one of the world's leading jazz festivals ("They All Came Out to Montreaux," June 7, 8, 12), and Swedish EDM artist Avicii ("Avicii – I'm Tim," June 9, 11, 14).
