FAA grounds SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets after rare crash-landing
The Federal Aviation Administration has grounded SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets pending an investigation to determine what caused a first-stage booster to crash onto a landing barge early Wednesday after helping launch another batch of Starlink internet satellites. After standing down from the piloted Polaris Dawn launch late Tuesday because of an unfavorable long-range forecast, SpaceX pressed ahead with the first of two planned back-to-back launches of Starlinks, one from Florida and the other from California. But the second flight was called off after the first stage used in the Florida launch crash-landed and toppled into the Atlantic Ocean while attempting to touch down on a SpaceX droneship stationed several hundred miles northeast of Cape Canaveral. The FAA said it would require an investigation, effectively grounding SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets — including the Polaris Dawn booster — until the probe is complete and corrective actions are approved. "A return to flight of the Falcon 9 booster rocket is based on the FAA determining that any system, process or procedure related to the anomaly does not affect public safety," the FAA said in a statement. "In addition, SpaceX may need to request and receive approval from the FAA to modify its license that incorporates any corrective actions and meet all other licensing requirements," the agency said. Late Tuesday, SpaceX delayed Wednesday's planned launch of the Polaris Dawn mission, a commercial flight featuring what will be the first non-government spacewalk, to Friday at the earliest because of predicted end-of-mission splashdown weather. The launching now is on indefinite hold pending the landing mishap investigation. The landing failure ended a string of 267 successful booster recoveries in a row dating back to February 2021. The Falcon 9's second stage, however, successfully carried 21 Starlink internet satellites to their planned orbit. The first stage landing appeared normal until the moment of touchdown  when more flames than usual were visible around the base of the rocket as  it neared the deck. A landing leg immediately collapsed on touchdown  and the booster, obscured by fire and smoke, tipped over the side of the  landing barge into the Atlantic Ocean. "After a successful  ascent, Falcon 9's first stage booster tipped  over following touchdown  on the A Shortfall of Gravitas droneship,"  SpaceX said on social  media. "Teams are assessing the  booster's flight data and  status." It was first stage B1062's  23rd and what turned out to be  its final launch and landing, a new  reuse record. SpaceX is working  toward certifying its Falcon 9 first  stages for up to 40 flights each. Shortly after the Florida Starlinks were deployed, the company called off the California launch, planned for 5:58 a.m. EDT, to give engineers more time to review telemetry and video footage, on the lookout for any signs of trouble that could affect other rockets. "Standing down from our second @Starlink launch of the night to give the team time to review booster landing data from the previous launch," SpaceX said. "A new target launch date will be shared once available.".
