Obama calls on Black men to support Harris' candidacy
Former President Barack Obamakicked off a campaign blitz for Vice President Kamala Harris Thursday in Pennsylvania, where he delivered remarks at a rally and spoke candidly to Black men at a campaign field office in Pittsburgh, urging them to get behind the vice president's candidacy. Obama thanked the volunteers working at the field office and said that he wanted to "speak some truths" after saying he heard reports that "we have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running," noting that this lack of enthusiasm appeared to be "more pronounced" with Black men. Obama contrasted Harris' upbringing and policy goals with those of former President Donald Trump, who he said has "consistently shown disregard, not just for our communities but for you as a person. And you're thinking about sitting out?" "I've got a problem with that. Because part of it makes me think, and I'm speaking to men directly, part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that," Obama said. "You're thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you, because you think that's a sign of strength, because that's what being a man is? Putting women down? That's not acceptable," Obama added. Obama's stop in Pittsburgh marks his debut as a battleground-state surrogate in the 2024 presidential election. He's expected to visit other swing states before Election Day, too. Within a few minutes of taking the stage at a rally later in the day, Obama focused his remarks on denouncing Trump, characterizing him as a whiny and selfish billionaire who only cares about "his ego and his money and his status." "This election is going to be tight because there are a lot of Americans who are still struggling out there," Obama said. "What I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you." "If Donald Trump does not care that a mob might attack his own vice president, do you think he cares about you," he said. Obama also noted that GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance, in the vice presidential debate "had the temerity to say Donald Trump salvaged the Affordable Care Act," the landmark health care law known as Obamacare. "Donald Trump spent his entire presidency trying to tear it down," Obama said, adding, "he couldn't even do that right." Obama mocked Trump for saying that eight years later, "he's got 'a concept of a plan' of how to replace it." He and former first lady Michelle Obama endorsed Harris in July, vowing to do everything they could to help her win the White House. Both have remained popular since the former president left office in 2017, and both addressed the Democratic convention in August. "Kamala Harris won't be focused on her problems, she'll be focused on yours," Obama said in a speech at the convention. "As president, she won't just cater to her own supporters and punish those who refuse to kiss the ring or bend the knee. She'll work on behalf of every American. That's who Kamala is." On Thursday, Obama poked fun at what he sees as Trump's disconnect from everyday Americans, asking the audience if they could imagine Trump changing a tire or a diaper. He contrasted this with Harris, highlighting her time working at McDonald's. Obama also accused Trump and Vance of consistently steering policy discussions toward immigration, no matter the issue. Obama on Thursday noted hurricanes Helene and Milton, and said, "It's times like this when you realize having honest, competent leadership in government really matters." "We don't need four more years of arrogance and bumbling and bluster and division. America is ready to turn the page," Obama said. "And the good news is Kamala Harris is ready to do the job." The former president also condemned the spread of misinformation surrounding the two hurricanes, questioning, "When did it become OK" to lie? Obama has remained a key figure in the Democratic party since he left office in 2017, and had remained silent amid the calls for his vice president, President Biden, to drop out of the race, although there were reports that Obama had privately expressed concerns about Mr. Biden as the nominee. Mr. Biden ultimately dropped out of the race in July, backing Harris. Obama and Harris have a long relationship, dating back to his run for Senate 20 years ago. Harris then backed Obama's history-making run for the White House, knocking on doors in Iowa. While Obama rallies support for Harris in Pennsylvania, the vice president is in Nevada, another key battleground, participating in a town hall event hosted by Televisa Univision before returning to Pennsylvania on Monday. Harris is expected to hold a campaign rally in Erie, marking her first visit to the bellwether county since launching her presidential run. But she has traveled to Pennsylvania over a dozen times in 2024, including seven since announcing her bid. Her surrogates, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz, have also been campaigning in the state.
