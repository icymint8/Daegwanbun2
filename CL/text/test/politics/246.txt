Biden assures Florida residents, "We've got your back" ahead of Milton
Washington â€” President Biden spoke aboutHurricane Miltonahead of its landfall Wednesday night and assured Florida residents and others who have been impacted by the recent storms, "We've got your back." He said his administration would offer support "for as long as it takes to rescue, recover and rebuild." Mr. Biden said Milton is expected to be "one of the most and worst destructive hurricanes to hit Florida in over a century," despite being downgraded to a Category 3 storm. "Milton still carries incredible destructiveness, can wipe out communities, can cause loss of life," Mr. Biden said. "I urge everyone in hurricane Milton's path to listen to local officials and follow all the safety instructions they give. At this point, evacuation is probably difficult, so I encourage people to look for safer shelter, sometimes moving just a few miles can mean the difference between life and death." The president assured Florida residents and others who have been impacted by the recent storms, "We've got your back." He said his administration would offer support "for as long as it takes to rescue, recover and rebuild." The president said he's surging federal assets to help. There are 20 million meals and 40 million liters of water ready to go, he said, adding that Pentagon has pre-positioned search and rescue teams, helicopters and water vehicles. Mr. Biden postponed his trip to Germany and Angola this week so he could oversee the federal government's response to the hurricane, which is barreling toward Florida's west coast as a Category 3 storm. Mr. Biden was scheduled to depart for Germany on Thursday, then travel to Angola in southern Africa. The trip would have marked the first time Mr. Biden visited Africa as president. Milton made landfall at 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time near Siesta Key, Florida. Officials who briefed the president and Vice President Kamala Harris on hurricane preparations said conditions would rapidly deteriorate. They warned of a storm surge 10 to 15 feet above ground level that extends from the Tampa Bay region south to the Fort Myers and Naples area. A larger area is at risk of devastating wind impacts, widespread power outages and structural damage, they said. Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator Deanna Criswell, who was traveling to Florida on Wednesday night, gave assurances that the agency is prepared to support every state affected by the storms. She also warned that it may be too late for some to safely evacuate. "Some of you may still be able to safely evacuate others, it may be too late," Criswell said during the White House press briefing. "Again, I need you to listen to your local officials, they will know exactly what you are still able to do." Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Biden said he had approved emergency declarations in Florida and has offered state and local officials "everything they need." He also gave them his personal phone number to contact him if issues arise, he said. "We have made available an unprecedented number of assets to deal with this crisis," the president said. "We're going to continue to do so until the job is done." The president also condemned those who have spread misinformation about the government's rescue and recovery operations, saying it is "harmful to those who need help the most." "Former President Trump has led the onslaught of lies," Mr. Biden said. He repeated the criticism in his evening remarks, saying that "these lies are un-American" and undermining the work of people who are putting their lives at stake to help those in need. Claims that people's property is being confiscated, that funds for the crisis are being diverted to undocumented migrants and that hurricane victims will only be offered $750 in assistance are "simply not true," Mr. Biden said. "It's beyond ridiculous. It's got to stop," he said. "Moments like this, there are no red or blue states, there's one United States of America, where neighbors are helping neighbors, volunteers and first responders are risking everything, including their own lives, to help their fellow Americans. State, local and federal officials are standing side by side." Asked by a reporter whether he'd considered calling Trump to ask him to stop making the false assertions, Mr. Biden dismissed the idea, saying, "Oh, c'mon.".
