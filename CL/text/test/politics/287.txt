Trump returns to Butler after assassination attempt
BUTLER, Pa. (KDKA) â€” Former President Donald Trump held a rally Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, where, almost three months ago, he was nearly assassinated. Appearing with him for the first time on the campaign trail was billionaire Elon Musk. "Tonight I returned to Butler in the aftermath of tragedy and heartache to deliver a simple message to the people of Pennsylvania and to the people of America," Trump said during his opening remarks at the Butler Farm Show grounds. "For 16 harrowing seconds during the gunfire, time stopped as this vicious monster unleashed pure evil from his sniper's perch not so far away," Trump said. "But by the hand of providence and the grace of God, that villain did not succeed in his goal, did not come close." He also praised the "men and women of the U.S. Secret Service who threw their bodies on top of mine without even a thought for their own lives." "There was not even a moment of doubt in their minds," Trump added.  Saturday's rally was set up to be almost identical to the one in July, complete with a large American flag blowing over the crowd, but with notable security exceptions. Secret Service expanded the security perimeter and stationed personnel on the roof from where the shooter fired.  Snipers stood atop a row of trailers put in place to block the line of site from that shed to the stage. Trump also paid tribute tofirefighter Corey Comperatore, who was killed in the July 13 assassination attempt while trying to shield his family from the bullets. Comperatore's widow and daughters were in attendance Saturday. Comperatore's July 13 seat in the crowd was marked by his firefighter's uniform.      "I can only begin to imagine the depths of your grief," Trump told the Comperatore family. "...Our hearts, for as long as we live, everybody in this stadium, and everybody that was there on that tragic evening, we think about Corey, we think about him a lot." He asked the crowd to join him in a moment of silence in Comperatore's memory prior to the playing of "Ave Maria." Musk, donning a MAGA hat, later appeared on stage with Trump, calling the November election "the most important of our lifetime." The Tesla founder repeated several common Republican talking points, alleging that Democrats want to "take away freedom of speech" and "the right to bear arms," and claiming that Trump "must win to preserve the Constitution, to preserve democracy in America." "This election could be decided by 1,000 votes, 500 votes," Musk said. Rob Hunt was standing just 25 yards away from the stage that day in July, and he returned again Saturday. "If he was willing to come back to where he was shot, I'm willing to come back," Hunt told CBS News, saying that Trump's return to Butler "means he's a fighter and he's gonna fight for us." Prior to Trump's address, his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, also spoke. As he has before, Vance claimed, without evidence, that it was Democratic rhetoric that led to the assassination attempt in Butler, as well as the apparent assassination attempt on Sept. 15 in West Palm Beach, Florida, saying "it was only a matter of time before somebody tried to kill him." "And with all the hatred they have spewed at President Trump, it was only a matter of time before somebody tried to kill him," Vance told the crowd. "And that's exactly what happened, not just here in Butler, Pennsylvania, but just a few weeks later in Florida, three weeks ago, while these guys still go out there and attacking him as a threat to democracy."  Trump's son, Eric Trump, and his wife, Lara Trump, co-chair of the Republican National Committee, also addressed the crowd. "Donald Trump was made for such a time as this," Lara Trump said.  According to the guest list, rally attendees includedone of the men who was injuredat the July 13 rally, along withMalphine Fogel,the mother ofMarc Fogel, a Pennsylvania native imprisoned in Russia. Butler County Commissioner Leslie Osche said the Butler County Emergency Services Agency was aunified communications bridgebetween the U.S. Secret Service, state and local police, fire, and EMS. On July 13, Trump was grazed in the ear,Comperatore was killed, and two others were injured when Crooks opened fire from the top of a nearby building. Unlike the July 13 rally, on Saturdaythere was one command post, and in that post, personnel from every law enforcement and emergency services agencies worked the rally. During the first rally, three separate radio systems createdcommunication delays. On Saturday, there was one for state and local police and one for the Secret Service. A Secret Service agent was also embedded with each state and local team. Goldinger told KDKA-TV earlier this week that the snipers posted inside the AGR building whereCrooks fired fromhad been asked to help again. Law enforcement were also on top of the AGR building. One person who expected to be at Saturday's rally was a man who was sitting behind Trump when the former president was grazed by the bullet. Chesher told CBS Pittsburgh he witnessed the attempted assassination. "It's been a couple of months but I'm still processing what happened that day. The emotions are all over the place," Chesher said. "...We're forever connected to President Trump now." Chesher said he believed there would be "a spiritual positivity" at Saturday's rally. He also planned to sit behind Trump again. "He said it should be the most secure event. In my heart, I believe it will be the most secure event. I think God's on our side though," Chesher said.
