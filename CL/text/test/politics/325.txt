Behind the scenes at the CBS VP debate stage
The first and likely only vice presidential debate between Sen. JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walzfocused the attention of millions of viewers as the candidates took to the stage on Tuesday, Oct. 1, at the CBS Broadcast Center, a historic studio in New York City. New York City hadn't hosted a presidential or vice presidential general election debate since 1960, when John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon met for their fourth debate. The debate stage was located at Studio 45 at the CBS Broadcast Center, located in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan. After the debate, campaign surrogates and the press headed to the spin room in Studio 42, another studio in the 800,000-square-foot Broadcast Center. Members of the media were watching the debate and filing their stories from a press pen set up in the cafeteria. Until this summer, Studio 45 was where "Inside Edition" was filmed. "Captain Kangaroo" was also taped in Studio 45 from 1964-1981. The two vice-presidential candidates, Vance and Walz were in the room for the debate along withmoderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan. The VP faceoff was the last scheduled debate of the 2024 presidential campaign. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have had one debate. Harris has accepted an invitation from CNN for another debate, but Trump rejected the idea, saying it's "too late" for another. The former president debated President Biden on June 27, and Mr. Biden dropped out of his reelection race a few weeks later. The90 minutes of debate timestarted at 9 p.m. ET, with two breaks of four minutes each. There was no live audience in the studio. For each question, the candidate who was asked the question had two minutes to answer, and the other candidate was allowed two minutes to respond. Following that, each candidate had one minute for additional rebuttals. And the moderators, at their discretion, gave candidates an additional minute each to continue a topic. CBS News reserved the right to mute the mics for the candidates, but otherwise, the mics were hot. In 1952, CBS acquired Sheffield Farms, which had been the world's largest milk distribution center. The building was used to bottle and distribute milk to retail locations by train â€” the train tracks are still located in the subbasement of the building. In the 1890s, the building housed a brewery. CBS News moved into the facility in 1964, and Walter Cronkite broadcast the 1964 election results from Studio 41, which is now home to the "Drew Barrymore Show." Before relocating to the CBS Broadcast Center, CBS was located in the Grand Central Terminal building. The giant studios and sound stages have been home to several soap operas, including "As the World Turns" in Studio 41 and "Guiding Light" in Studio 42. "Last Week Tonight with John Oliver" films at Studio 42. In the early 1980s, CBS added 176,400 square feet to the 500,000-square-foot building as part of a $100 million update. The CBS Broadcast Center is home to CBS News 24/7, CBS Sports and Sports Network, CBS News New York (WCBS-TV) and several other corporate and third-party productions. It's also the distribution center for the CBS Television Network. CBS News shows are shot at a variety of locations. "CBS Evening News" is recorded in Washington, D.C., while "CBS Mornings" is filmed in Times Square at the Paramount Global headquarters. Several CBS News 24/7 shows are filmed at the Broadcast Center, including "The Daily Report with John Dickerson" and "CBS Morning News" at Studio 57. WCBS-TV films at Studio 46.
