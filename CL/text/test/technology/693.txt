Apple's new iPhone 16 unveiled at "Glowtime" event
Appleunveiled its new iPhone 16at the tech giant's "It's Glowtime" event Monday, at which it touted upgraded capabilities and designs for its new phones and other devices. The event, held at Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters, also marked the tech giant's foray in earnest into generative AI. Called Apple Intelligence, Apple's AI is designed to help simplify everyday tasks, like taking notes, composing emails, and sorting photos. "The next generation of iPhone has been designed for Apple Intelligence from the ground up," Apple CEO Tim Cook said. "It marks the beginning of an exciting new era. iPhone 16 raises the bar for what an iPhone can do." The new iPhone 16 is water and dust resistant, and comes in five different colors, Apple said. Among the upgrades from the last generation are a bigger battery and larger display sizes — the iPhone 16's display measures 6.1 inches, while the iPhone 16 Plus measures 6.7 inches. The new iPhone models also feature a new and improved camera and control button that makes it easier to capture photos. These and other upgrades are powered by the new A18 chip, Apple said. The chip is capable of running large generative AI models, like Apple Intelligence. The iPhone 16 starts at $799 while the iPhone Plus costs $899 and up.  The iPhone 16 Pro, the more premium model, features a 6.3 inch display, while the Pro Plus measures 6.9 inches. The phones come in four titanium finishes: black, white, natural and a new desert shade. The devices will be available for pre-order beginning on Friday and will hit store shelves on September 20. The iPhone 16 Pro starts at $999, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max starts at $1,199, Apple said. Apple Intelligence will be available via a software update, iOS 18, set to arrive by October, the company previously said. The iPhone 16 Pro models revealed at the Apple event have 48 megapixel fusion cameras that allow users to capture high-resolution images with ease through a redesigned capture button, Apple said. Apple Intelligence also adds new camera capabilities, including what the company calls Visual Intelligence. For example, a new feature lets users point their camera at a dog, click and hold the control button, and Apple Intelligence will provide information about its breed. Use the same tool to point at a restaurant for information about its opening hours and menu. It's similar to what the Shazam app does with music — users open the app, which listens to songs playing in the background, and identifies them. Consumer Reports tech expert Nicholas De Leon told CBS MoneyWatch that the first consumers to get their hands on the new iPhone 16 models and test Apple Intelligence features will be the real judges of whether these functions add significant value. "If nothing else, it's a big deal because this is the first iPhone of the generative AI era," he told CBS MoneyWatch. But the new iPhone launch also comes as many consumers appear content to keep their older phones, given the costs of upgrading, and amid ongoing debate over the impact of technologies such as mobile devices and social media on our health. "We are on our phones 24/7, and people are examining their relationship with these tools," De Leon said. Cook kicked off the event by presenting new base and "Ultra" Apple Watch models, which start at $399 and $799, respectively. The new series 10 watch can be pre-ordered immediately and will be available on September 10. The Ultra can also be pre-ordered for delivery September 20. The Apple Watch Series 10 features the company's biggest display and thinnest design to-date.Cook called them "the most beautiful and capable watches we've ever created." Notably, the new watch has a tool that can detect sleep apnea, a condition that often goes undiagnosed and that can cause fatigue and irritability. It has the ability to measure a metric that detects breathing disturbances, when users wear it during their sleep. Cook also pulled back the curtain on the company's latest ear buds — the AirPods 4, plus AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods Max 2, with some models featuring health tech tools. AirPods Pro 2 incorporate an over-the-counter, professional grade hearing aid, Apple said. The event marks what Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives called Apple's "biggest upgrade cycle in its history." "It's a historic event that kicks off the consumer AI revolution, now coming to Apple," he told CBS MoneyWatch. "About 20% of the world will ultimately interact with AI through an Apple device, and it all starts today." Ives predicts it will take until the end of the year for Apple Intelligence to fully function on phones. He also says the AI will compel Apple customers who haven't upgraded their iPhones in some time to purchase the latest model. The iPhone accounted for roughly 60% of Apple's $39 billion in sales last quarter. "Three-hundred-millions iPhones haven't upgraded in four years, so that creates what we believe is going to be the strongest iPhone unit year in Apple's history," Ives said. He added that consumers with an aversion to AI can just turn the features off. Still, not all experts see the need for users with older iPhones toupgradejust yet, even with the advent of Apple Intelligence. "While I agree that Apple Intelligence has long-term potential, I'm not convinced that its first iteration will deliver the game-changing usability that many anticipate," wrote Jason Perlow, senior contributing writer at ZDNet in a recent article.
