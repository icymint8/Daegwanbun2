Microsoft said some of its 365 services are experiencing problems that are keeping customers from using the cloud-based apps, which include Word, PowerPoint and Outlook. The company said Tuesday it has "identified a potential networking issue" and is working on solving the problem. Reports of outages with Microsoft 365 programs spiked on DownDetector on Tuesday morning, with users reporting problems with Outlook and other apps. However, the outage appeared to clear up by Tuesday afternoon, with Microsoft saying its Microsoft 365 admin center and Azure cloud service were available as of 6 p.m. Eastern.

In an update, Microsoft said that the impacted services include, but aren't limited to, Microsoft 365 admin center, Intune, Entra and Power Platform. "Initial indications are that the following services are not impacted: SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, Microsoft Teams, Exchange Online," it added.
