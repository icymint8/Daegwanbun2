U.S. News lists its best electric and hybrid vehicles for 2024
Cars from Hyundai and Volvo claimed five of the top 10 spots on U.S. News & World Report's ranking of the best electric and hybrid vehicles for 2024, while Tesla is shut out. Testers with the publication evaluated nearly 100 EVs and hybrids, scoring them based on price, driving range, performance, safety, reliability, interior and other factors. The best EVs offer a mix of power, speed and fast-charging capabilities, said John Vincent, senior editor for vehicle testing. "Today there's an electric vehicle for almost every segment of the market," he told CBS MoneyWatch. "Electric cars are our future. They're going to come faster than some people think, and they really solve a lot of problems." For now, however, many motorists remain unconvinced, with concerns about range, charging speeds and reliability. Although a record 1.2 million EVs were sold in the U.S. last year, according to Cox Automotive data, that amounted to just under 8% of the automobile market. EVs have more problems and are generally less reliable than gas-powered cars, according to a 2023studyfrom Consumer Reports. U.S. News' list underscores the fierce competition today in electric cars as Tesla slashes its vehicles prices to boost sales. "Tesla remains the market leader [in EV sales)], but there are just better options out there now," Vincent said. Here are U.S. News' top 10 electric and hybrid vehicles for 2024. This luxury sedan, which starts at $69,076, has the longest driving range of any EV, according to a U.S. News review.  The Lucid Air "is a very cool car," Vincent said. "It's incredibly fast, it's incredibly efficient and can drive 500 miles on a single charge. It's a better Tesla Model S than the Tesla Model S." The XC40 Recharge scores well in safety, partly because it has features like lane-departure warning and traffic-sign recognition, according to U.S. News. The vehicle starts at $52,450 and and can travel 293 miles on a single charge. The Ioniq 5 also scores well in safety, with such features as forward automatic emergency braking and rear cross-traffic alert. The vehicle starts at $41,800 and has a single charge driving range of 220 miles. This spacious sedan seats five and offers a smooth ride, according to a U.S. News review. Its standard base model starts at $37,500, while a higher-end model, the Limited, starts at $53,650. The electric version of Ford's most popular pickup truck has one of the most spacious cabins in its class, according to U.S. News. The base model can tow 5,000 pounds and the upgraded version can tow 7,700. "You can move from the gas-powered F-150 to the F-150 Lightning and not notice a lot of difference in how it performs," U.S. News' Vincent said. The Volvo S60 offers some of the fastest battery charging times on the market, according to U.S. News. The vehicle can get a full charge in about nine hours with a 120-volt power outlet and in around four hours using a 240-volt outlet. The S60 comes in five different models, ranging in price from $51,950 to $58,550.
