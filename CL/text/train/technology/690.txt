Microsoft says service issues "fully resolved" after outage shuts down systems
Microsoft services were unavailable for many customers early Thursday, with users reporting problems accessing a number of the technology giant's tools, according toDowndetector. The reports relate to issues across multiple Microsoft products including Xbox; Microsoft 365, which encompasses a suite of business tools; Microsoft Teams; Outlook and Azure, its cloud-computing service. Reports of issues started to spike just before 8 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday. By 9 a.m., more than 24,000 outages had been reported by users of Microsoft 365 alone, according to Downdetector, which only reports incidents for which there is a high volume of complaints compared with a typical day. "Downdetector users are reporting possible issues with Microsoft services when connecting through AT&T Fiber in the US East region," read a banner on the top of the website functionality tracker's website. Microsoft customers also noted the outages on social media, with one person posting on X that the "outage appears to be wreaking havoc this morning." After initially posting a statement on X that it was "investigating an issue where users may be unable to access multiple Microsoft 365 services," the company says services have been restored. "A third-party Internet Service Provider incident that impacted a subset of their customers' ability to access our services is now fully resolved," a Microsoft spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.
