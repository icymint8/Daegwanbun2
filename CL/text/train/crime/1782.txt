2 dead, 14 wounded after shooting at Juneteenth celebration in Texas
A shooting at a Juneteenth celebration at a Texas park left two people dead and at least 14 wounded on Saturday, authorities said. The shooting happened just before 11 p.m. Saturday at Old Settlers Park in Round Rock, a city about 19 miles north of Austin. Round Rock Police Chief Allen Banks said the shooting was sparked after an altercation between two groups during a concert at the event. The shooting took place near a vendor area away from the stage. The two victims who were pronounced dead at the scene were not involved in the altercation, he said. Round Rock Police confirmed later Sunday that 14 victims with gunshot wounds were taken to local hospitals after the shooting. Police said they are searching for a suspect in connection with the shooting. He is described as approximately 5 feet 7 inches tall with a thin build and short dreadlocks. Police officers and fire department personnel who were attending the event immediately began providing emergency medical care to multiple wounded victims, who were then transported to local hospitals, Allen said. Six people — four adults and two children — were taken to local trauma facilities, all with potentially serious injuries, according to a post on X by Austin-Travis County EMS earlier Sunday. "It breaks your heart for a family that was coming out to enjoy their evening and now their life is forever changed as a result of somebody who could care less about somebody else's life," Allen said. According to CBS affiliate KEYE-TV, the Juneteenth celebration was billed as a free, family-friendly event. Performers at the concert included DJ Hella Yella and Paul Wall, who wrote in a post on social media, "Round Rock, we are praying for everybody.".
