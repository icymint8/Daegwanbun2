Lane was one of four former officers convicted in Floyd's murder, which sparked protests in Minnesota and across the globe. Chauvin was convicted on state charges of murder and manslaughter and sentenced to 22.5 years. Last fall, the U.S. Supreme Court declined his appeal of that conviction. He also pleaded guilty to federal charges of violating Floyd's rights and was given a 21-year sentence. J. Alexander Kueng pleaded guilty to manslaughter and sentenced to 3.5 years. Tou Thao was convicted of second-degree aiding and abetting manslaughter and sentenced to nearly five years. Kueng and Thao were also both found guilty of civil rights violations, receiving three- and 3.5-year sentences, respectively. All of the state and federal sentences were concurrent. In the wake of Floyd's murder, the Minneapolis Police Department faced dual investigations from the Minnesota Department of Human Rights and the U.S. Department of Justice. Both investigations found yearslong patterns of discriminatory practices and mandated the city enter into reformatory consent decrees.
