Woman and her 3 young children found shot to death in a car in Utah
A woman and her three children were found shot to death in a car in Utah. Authorities said they do not believe there is any ongoing threat to the public but haven't said what they believe happened. A family member called 911 just before 10 p.m. Tuesday to report finding the four people dead in a vehicle at a residence in West Haven, a city near Ogden and north of Salt Lake City, Weber County officials said in a news statement. Weber County sheriff deputies said when they arrived they found the four people — a 32-year-old woman, a 4-year-old boy, a 2-year-old girl and a 1-year-old girl — dead inside the car. Their names were not made public. Deputies said they found evidence of gunshot trauma, but the cause of death was still under investigation.
