Justin Timberlake to agree to plea deal in DWI, sources say
SAG HARBOR, N.Y. -- Justin Timberlake is expected to agree to a plea deal in his DWI case, sources tell CBS News New York. Timberlake will agree to plead to a lesser traffic violation charge, and the DWI charge against him will be dropped, sources with the Suffolk County District Attorney's office tell CBS News New York's Jennifer McLogan. The deal is expected to happen during an 11 a.m. court hearing Friday in Sag Harbor, Long Island.  Timberlake was arrested for DWI over the summerand initially pleaded not guilty. The 43-year-old singer was pulled over around 12:30 a.m. on June 18 in the Hamptons village, which is about 100 miles from New York City. Police said his BMW drove through a stop sign, then into the wrong side of the road. The arresting officer said his eyes were bloodshot and glassy and his breath smelled of alcohol. "I had one martini and I followed my friends home," Timberlake allegedly told the officer. According to court documents, he refused to submit to a breath test three times. He was charged with DWI and released on his own recognizance. Timberlake's lawyer, Edward Burke Jr., has said his client "was not intoxicated." At his last court hearing, the judge suspended the singer's license, which is standard practice with DWI cases in New York. Days after his arrest, Timberlake's world tour arrived in Chicago, where he told fans, "it's been a tough week." "We've been together through ups and downs, lefts and rights. It's been a tough week, but you're here, and I'm here," he said. His tour later stopped at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan and comes to Brooklyn and Newark in October. Timberlake is among the best-selling musicians in the world and has 10 Grammys and four Emmys. The former Disney Mouseketeer launched his career with NSYNC before going solo and even acting in films, like "The Social Network" and "Friends with Benefits.".
