Trump's policy plans and platform on key issues for the 2024 election
Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris faced off in their first — and possibly only — debate of the 2024 presidential campaign on Sept. 10, giving Americans the chance to hear what they have to say about some of the most pressing issues facing the country, including the economy, immigration, abortion access, foreign affairs and more. Trump has criticized Democrats' handing of the economy and has shared his positions on what should be done about an array of issues, including taxes, inflation and immigration. Here are some key points from the plans he's offered, information about his record and what he's said about some of these subjects. (A similar overview of Harris' positions can be found here.) Trump and Harris have competing tax plans. Both nominees' plans would have to be passed by Congress, which has the power of the purse. Here's what Trump has proposed so far: Trump and Harris have opposing views on abortion access, an issue that could be a crucial motivator for voters in November. Access to in vitro fertilization (IVF) services became a campaign issue after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February that frozen embryos created during the IVF process could be considered children. The decision threatened the availability of IVF services in Alabama and thrust access to fertility treatments into the national conversation, including among the presidential candidates. Both Harris and Trump have at times been critical of Israel's handling of its war against Hamas in Gaza. But neither has threatened to pull support for the ally. Trump has continued to talk tough against China while praising its leader Xi Jinping. It's unclear whether Harris would seek to cut a new nuclear deal with Iran if she wins the election. Trump rejected the Obama-era deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and removed the U.S. from the international agreement.
