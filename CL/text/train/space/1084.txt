Photos of the blue supermoon show August's rare lunar phenomenon
A rare spectacle began Sunday night as an August supermoon blue moon rose into the sky. The first of 2024's four consecutive supermoons, the blue moon - also known as the Sturgeon Moon - was expected to reach peak illumination on Monday and shine brightly through Wednesday. According to NASA, 100% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated on Monday, and 99% will be illuminated on Tuesday. Here are some photos of the rare phenomenon from around the world. August's full moon is the first of four consecutive supermoons this year. The September full moon – known as the Harvest Moon – will reach peak illumination on Tuesday, Sept. 17. The Hunter's Moon will peak on Thursday, Oct. 17 and the final supermoon – known as the Beaver Moon – will peak on Friday, Nov. 15.
