Photos from around the world of the super blue moon
As millions of stargazers around the world looked at the sky Wednesday night, they saw a full moon appearing larger than average. It was another "supermoon" — the second one in August 2023, making it a "blue moon." Unlike what the name suggests, a blue moon is not actually blue in color. Rather, it signifies the second full moon within a single month — hence the phrase, "once in a blue moon."  The "supermoon" phenomenon occurs when the moon's orbit is closest to Earth at the same time the moon is full. While around 25% of full moons are supermoons, just 3% of full moons are blue moons,according to NASA. On average, supermoons are about 16% brighter than an average moon. They also appear bigger than the average full moon — with NASA comparing the size difference to that between a quarter and a nickel. Saturn could also be seen appearing alongside the moon wherever skies were clear — adding to the celestial celebration.  Here are some photos of the super blue moon from around the world. Those who missed seeing a blue moon will have to wait quite a while before the next one inMay 2026. And if you're waiting for the next super blue moon, it'll be even longer — until 2037, when astronomy fans will get to seesuper blue moonsin January and March.
