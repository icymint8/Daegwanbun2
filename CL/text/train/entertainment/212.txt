The judge in actor Alec Baldwin's trial on a charge of involuntary manslaughter sent the jury home early Friday, as attorneys argued overa defense motion, including questioning a witness who had already testified in the case. Baldwin is charged in the 2021 on-set shooting of cinematographerHalyna Hutchins. If convicted, he could face up to 18 months in prison. Hehas pleaded not guilty, and has said he did not pull the trigger. Attorneys forHannah Gutierrez-Reed— the film's armorer, who has already been convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the shooting — had earlier said they expected her to be called to testify Friday. The judge earlier rejected a motion by the prosecution to compel her to testify. Her attorneys have said she plans to plead the fifth. Gutierrez-Reed is already serving 18 months in prison for her role in the shooting on the set at Bonanza Creek Ranch, a popular filming location near Santa Fe. The prosecution, which called both the gun's manufacturer and a representative of the firm that imported it to testify Thursday, ended the day by calling the case's lead detective, sheriff's Cpl. Alexandria Hancock, to the stand. Her testimony was expected to continue Friday, but after lengthy arguments before the jury entered the courtroom over the motion the judge elected to push back testimony to Monday and excused the jury. Thursday's testimony saw a lengthy cross-examination of crime scene technician Marissa Poppell by Baldwin's defense attorney Alex Spiro, who suggested the searches of a prop truck and a warehouse for the live ammunition that ultimately were loaded in Baldwin's prop gun, a revolver, were shoddy and subpar. Baldwin has been joined in the courtroom by his wife, Hilaria Baldwin, for each day of testimony in the trial, which is scheduled through July 19.
