The iconic hat worn by the titular character in "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" fetched $630,000 at auction on Thursday alongside movie memorabilia from "Star Wars", "Harry Potter" and "James Bond" productions.

The hat was worn by Ford or his stunt double, American stuntman Dean Ferrandini, in many of the movie's most memorable scenes, said the auction house, including the yellow raft on the snow-covered mountain, as well as in the river scene. Ferrandini, who worked on over 100 films and shows during his career, died last year. The hat came from his collection, the BBC reported. The fedora was created by the Herbert Johnson Hat Company in London and perched on Jones' head as he raced from London to Sri Lanka to the United States where the movie was shot. The sweatband is stamped with the initials "I J" in gold, a feature applied specifically to the hats made for the three original installments of the Indiana Jones saga, the auction house said. Made of sable-colored rabbit felt the fedora featured a dark brown ribbon and a leather sweatband and incorporated a more tapered crown than the prior film. Another "Temple of Doom" fedora auctioned in 2021 sold for just over $431,000, including a buyer's premium, according to the auction house.
