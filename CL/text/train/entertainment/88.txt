Beverly got his start in music early, performing as a soloist in church while growing up in Philadelphia's East Germantown neighborhood. As a teen, he sang with an ensemble called "The Silhouettes" before forming his own doo-wop group, "The Blenders." He formed the group "Raw Soul" in Philly in 1970, which would eventually become known as "Frankie Beverly and Maze." Beverly then moved to San Francisco where he worked with legend Marvin Gaye, according to Beverly's website. "The Motown master would take the group under his wing and it was Gaye who suggested the group change their name. Frankie Beverly and Maze was born," the website read. Beverly was the lead singer, songwriter, producer and founder of the band Frankie Beverly and Maze. In May, Beverly, along with Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, Councilmember Cindy Bass and community members, gathered for thestreet dedication of "Frankie Beverly Way" in East Germantown. "This is to someone who has made a significant contribution to the lives of Philadelphians," Bass said during the dedication. "Anyone who knows music knows that Philadelphia is a music town, and Frankie has made such a contribution." The music of Frankie Beverly and Maze became a staple in the Black community. With songs like "Before I Let Go," "Joy and Pain," and "Happy Feelin's," their sound and soulful style became the soundtrack to cookouts, family reunions, and for some, the electric slide. Beverly's magnum opus "Before I Let Go", was covered by Beyonc√© in 2019 in her live album "Homecoming." Beverly and his band just completed their "I Wanna Thank You Farewell Tour" earlier this summer. His final shows were at The Dell Music Center in North Philadelphia.
