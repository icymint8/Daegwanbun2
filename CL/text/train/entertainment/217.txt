She also reflected on the "amazing feeling when your world shifts." "Suddenly, it's not about you," she said. "It's not about anything other than the tiny little life that's inside you, that you are now in charge of protecting." "That little tiny life is a baby, a little tiny human that's yours, that you have to make sure you protect, you love, you take care of," said Blanchard, who started to tear up." All of the things I wished I could have had when I was little. ... All of the things that I wanted in a mother, I want to give to this baby." "I just want to be a good mother for my child, I want to be everything my mother wasn't.".
