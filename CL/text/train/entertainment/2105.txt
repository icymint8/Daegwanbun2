Who won Tony Awards for 2024: full list of winners and nominees
"The Outsiders" took home the award for best musical and "Stereophonic" earned the coveted best play award at the 2024 Tony Awards, as the best of Broadway was honored Sunday night.  "Hell's Kitchen," the jukebox musical featuring songs by and inspired by the life of Alicia Keys, and "Stereophonic," a play that, while not a musical, does feature several original songs from Arcade Fire's Will Butler, both earned the most nominations with 13 each coming into the night. While "Hell's Kitchen" missed out on best musical, Maleah Joi Moon, the show's star, won best lead actress in a musical for her first ever Tony Award win. Several movie and TV stars were also nominated for Tony Awards for their performances on stage this year, including Jessica Lange, Rachel McAdams, Sarah Paulson — who won best lead actress in a play —  and Daniel Radcliffe, who won best featured actor in a musical for his role in the revival of Stephen Sondheim's "Merrily We Roll Along." Ariana DeBose returned to host the main program for the third year in a row. Several awards were given out before the TV broadcast began, during "The Tony Awards: Act One," hosted by Julianne Hough and Utkarsh Ambudkar. The show featured performances from every best musical nominee, including a surprise performance from Alicia Keys and Jay-Z, and also featured a musical number from "Stereophonic."
