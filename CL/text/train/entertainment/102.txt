Sergio Mendes, Brazilian bossa nova legend, dies at 83
Sergio Mendes, the Brazilian Grammy-winning musician whose hit "Mas Que Nada" made him a global legend, died after months of battling the effects of long COVID, his publicist Karen Vock confirmed to CBS News on Friday. He was 83. The Brazilian pianist, songwriter and arranger died on Thursday in Los Angeles, his family said in a statement. "His wife and musical partner for the past 54 years, Gracinha Leporace Mendes, was by his side, as were his loving children," the statement Friday said. "Mendes last performed in November 2023 to sold out and wildly enthusiastic houses in Paris, London and Barcelona." His composition "Mas Que Nada" was one of the songs that helped popularize the Brazilian music genre bossa nova worldwide in the 1960s. In 2006, a modern version of the song topped U.S. charts, as performed by Black Eyed Peas. It was included in his album "Timeless," produced by will.i.am and featuring Stevie Wonder, Justin Timberlake and the Black Eyed Peas, among others. "Sergio Mendes was my brother from another country," trumpet player Herb Alpert wrote on Facebook, along with a photo from decades ago, sitting next to Mendes at the piano. "He was a true friend and extremely gifted musician who brought Brazilian music in all its iterations to the entire world with elegance." Mendes also composed the soundtrack for the film "Pel√©," featuring saxophonist Gerry Mulligan, and even produced an album recorded by the Brazilian legendary soccer player. Mendes won the 1992 Grammy Award for Best World Music Album for "Brasileiro" and two Latin Grammy Awards. He also received an Oscar nomination in 2012 for Best Original Song for "Real in Rio," from the animated film "Rio.".
